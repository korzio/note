# Introduction

### A command-line interface or command language interpreter (CLI), is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of lines of text (command lines). A program which handles the interface is called a command language interpreter or shell.

# Porque?

### Which CLI program
- Do you like?
- Do you use the most?

.center[

- Why JavaScript?
- Why Node?

---

# Popular CLIs

.right-code[![NPM](assets/icons/trim/npm.png)]
.right-code[![gulp](assets/gulp.png)]

### Top

- `git`
- `npm`

### Runners

- gulp
- grunt

### Generators & Developer Experience

- yeoman
- create-react-app
- angular-cli
- polymer-cli

# Why CLI?

### .green[`+`]

- **Tools** for 
  - improving **developer experience** and
  - task automation
- *which allow to gain even more!*
- *That's fun!*

### .red[`-`]?

---

# Why Node?

### .green[`+`]

- Practice with `JavaScript`
- [Atwood's Law](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-principle-of-least-power/) - *any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript*
- Fast and easy to develop
- A rich infrastructure with all kinds of packages and libraries with `npm` 
- Modules & plug'n'play

### .red[`-`]?
- `Node` need to be installed?!

.hidden[

# Question

### > Why force the consumer to have all of node installed on their machine for a simple CLI?

![question](assets/question.png)

- We build for Fronted developers, they have node installed already

- In some environments (browsers, are you crazy?!) `Node` even doesn't need to be installed

# Shell

.hidden[
  http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/
  
  The restricted shell
  - When invoked as rbash or with the --restricted or -r option, the following happens:
  - The cd built-in is disabled.
  - Setting or unsetting SHELL, PATH, ENV or BASH_ENV is not possible.
  - Command names can no longer contain slashes.
  - Filenames containing a slash are not allowed with the . (source) built-in command.
  - The hash built-in does not accept slashes with the -p option.
  - Import of functions at startup is disabled.
  - SHELLOPTS is ignored at startup.
  - Output redirection using >, >|, ><, >&, &> and >> is disabled.
  - The exec built-in is disabled.
  - The -f and -d options are disabled for the enable built-in.
  - A default PATH cannot be specified with the command built-in.
  - Turning off restricted mode is not possible.
  
  After the forking process, the address space of the child process is overwritten with the new process data. This is done through an exec call to the system.
]

> a **program** that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform

```bash
cat /etc/shells   # List of shells
cat /etc/passwd   # Default shell
```

### What is your default shell?

- Interactive, non-interactive, login, non-login
- Built-in commands and scripts
- When a program is executed, a Bash process is forked

```bash
htop + bash
```

# Principles Question

.half-image.right-image[
  ![question](assets/question_ru.png)
]

### Which basic principles of designing a `CLI` program you might mention?

---

# Principles

- A user want to understand what's happening
  - `help`
  - `version`
  - `logs, messages, errors`
  
.right-image[![kiss](assets/kiss.png)]

- [UNIX Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
  - `Do One Thing and Do It Well`
  - `KISS`
  - `Modular and composable programs`

- Environments
  - `linux, mac os, windows`
  - `package`

# package.json

```json
{
  "name": "my-test-cli",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Hello CLI",
  "main": "server.js",
  "bin": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "man" : "./man/doc.1"
}
```

- `main` - exports
- `bin` - make an executable `symlink` inside `PATH`, `./node_modules/.bin/`
- `url` - [`npm bugs`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#bugs) - feedback on a package 
ðŸ¤—

---

# Execution

- `shebang` specifies an interpeter in `*nix` systems

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
```

- `process.argv` contains arguments which a program is called with

<br>

### What will be an output of running `server.js`?

```javascript
console.log(process.argv)
```

<br>

```bash
node server hello world
```

- [`repl`](https://nodejs.org/api/repl.html) internal module provides a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) implementation

---

# Exercise

---

# Commander.js

```javascript
var program = require('commander');

program
  .version('0.1.0')
  .option('-p, --peppers', 'Add peppers')
  .option('-P, --pineapple', 'Add pineapple')
  .option('-b, --bbq-sauce', 'Add bbq sauce')
  .parse(process.argv);

console.log('you ordered a pizza with:');
if (program.peppers) console.log('  - peppers');
if (program.pineapple) console.log('  - pineapple');
if (program.bbqSauce) console.log('  - bbq');
console.log('  - %s cheese', program.cheese);
```

### *Heroku, SalesForce* framework to build CLIs

### Features

- `TypeScript` (can be `JavaScript`)
- Auto-documentation
- Parse Arguments
  - Flags VS Arguments
- Code generation (with `yeoman`)
  - Single Commands VS Multi Commands
- Project' folders structure
- Hooks - a way to extend commands behavior
- Test & Build & Package

---

# oclif Main Concepts

- Extend `Command` class

```
import Command from '@oclif/command'

export class MyCommand extends Command {
  static description = 'description of this example command'

  async run() {
    console.log('running my command')
  }
}
```

## Plugins & Core

- `@oclif/config` - base config object and standard interfaces for oclif components
- `@oclif/plugin-plugins` - install plugins with the CLI

# TypeScript
